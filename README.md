# Angular Workshop

The intent behind this mini-project is to replicate a real-world use-case that was
encountered in 2024; a bloated component that was too slow and hard to understand/navigate/extend.

In the `improved` branch, you can find solutions to improve and clarify the code.

This workshop focuses on:
* Reactivity with Observables and Signals
  * RxJS operators
* Domain / Business architecture
* Performance improvements

This workshop does not focus on all aspects (e.g., UX)

## Development server
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.
To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Slides
Quick slides were generated and can be viewed using
```bash
npx marp --server slides
```

Or use the PDF generated by:
```bash
npx marp slides -o slides/slides.pdf
```
